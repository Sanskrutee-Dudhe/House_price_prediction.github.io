## Introduction

Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers. Machine learning can play a vital role in this by analyzing historical data and extracting patterns to make predictions. This project serves as an example of how machine learning can be used for house price prediction.

## Dataset

We have used a dataset containing information about various houses. The dataset includes features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, floors, and more. The target variable is the selling price of the houses.



## Methods and Techniques

### Python Libraries Used

This project leverages several Python libraries for data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and machine learning, including but not limited to:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating custom data visualizations and plots.
- **Scikit-Learn (sklearn)**: For machine learning modeling and evaluation.

### Machine Learning Models

We explored various machine learning models to predict house prices. Some of the key models we experimented with include:

- **Linear Regression**

- **Decision Tree**

- **Random Forest**

- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **Polynomial Regression (PSA)**
### Model Evaluation

We used various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of our machine learning models, including:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**

The combination of these techniques and models allowed us to build an accurate house price prediction system.


## Results

Document the results of your house price prediction model, including evaluation metrics and any visualizations that help explain the model's performance  with the help of web application.
